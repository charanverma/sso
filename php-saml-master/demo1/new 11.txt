Question:

1. We have one php/drupal application and need to integrate with NYCID.
  since there is no DOIIT  suggested lib/tool to exchange saml 2.0 messages for php/drupal
  if we come up with own lib/tool generated messages, will DOIIT IPD/Connector process?
  if existing DOIIT Idp/connector does not process messages, will DOIIT support to customize at their end?  
  
2. Samples saml 2.0 messages to help DOT team to format accordingly?
